# Hierarchical clustering analysis of 25mers in the 'Montmorency' genome to assign chromosomes to subgenomes
# Creation of heatmap using same 25mer abundances per chromosome to illustrate groups of 25mers that appear to designate subgenomes

# Set working directory to folder where dumps.col files are located
# This is also very closely based on Kamil Jaron's oh-know tutorial: https://github.com/KamilSJaron/oh-know/wiki/Separate-sub-genomes-of-an-allopolyploid
# But we had to modify it because we have *three* subgenomes kicking around in here

## FOR EACH SET OF HOMOEOLOGS (each set designated based on synteny to the peach genome, see main paper figure 1):
## import jellyfish data file
##### PAIR 01
chr1<-read.table("chr1.jf.dumps.larger10.col", header=F) %>%
  'colnames<-' (c("kmer", "chr1"))
chr2<-read.table("chr2.jf.dumps.larger10.col", header=F) %>%
  'colnames<-' (c("kmer", "chr2"))
chr3<-read.table("chr3.jf.dumps.larger10.col", header=F) %>%
  'colnames<-' (c("kmer", "chr3"))

pair01<-full_join(chr1, chr2, by="kmer") %>% full_join(chr3, by = "kmer")
head(pair01)

# filter to retain only 25mers that are present at least 2x as often in one homoeolog as in one or both of its sisters
filtered_pair01<- pair01 %>% filter(chr1 > 2*chr2 | chr2 > 2*chr1  |
                                      chr3 > 2*chr1 | chr1 > 2*chr3 |
                                      chr3 > 2*chr2 | chr3 > 2*chr2)
nrow(filtered_pair01) #sanity check

## Now do this for the other 8 homoeolog groups (ommitted here for the sake of space)

  full_join(filtered_pair07, by="kmer") %>% full_join(filtered_pair08, by="kmer")

# 22 chr analysis: Merge filtered pair objects 1-7 and chromosome 24 (chr8B)
df<-full_join(filtered_pair01, filtered_pair02, by="kmer") %>%
  full_join(filtered_pair03, by="kmer") %>% full_join(filtered_pair04, by="kmer") %>%

### Heatmap of 25mer abundances (similar to what Mitros et al., 2020 did for their figure 1b, hence my plot object name https://rdcu.be/c1gxC)
# start with transversed_squeaky_cleaned_df object from above analysis

# optional: our most abundant 25mer group was 2 25mers that didn't clearly designate a subgenome but did throw off my heatmap
#  so I filtered them out of my initial df (above) before going back through to the transversed_squeaky_cleaned_df step:
# df <- df %>% filter(kmer != "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" &
#                     kmer != "TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT")
